This project develops and compares machine learning regression models to predict future shipping costs based on various variables and their correlations. The process includes splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, applying different algorithms, and evaluating their performance to identify the best predictive model. Python and BrainToy MLOS were used for this purpose.
